# ⚡ WattByte Substation Report

This project generates a PDF report of energy substations found within a selected geographic area.

You just provide the coordinates and choose the energy provider (AESO or ERCOT), and it will create a clean, styled PDF that includes the substation name, location, and voltage.

## ✅ Features

* Fetches real substation data from OpenStreetMap
* Generates a nicely formatted PDF report
* Includes basic details like name, coordinates, and voltage
* Uses emojis and a logo for a modern look

## 🛠️ Still in Progress

This project will eventually become a full API connected to a front-end, but for now it’s just generating the PDF part.

## 📁 Files Needed

Make sure to include:

* `fonts/Symbola.ttf` – for emoji support
* `images/logo.jpeg` – your custom logo

---

## 🔍 Example Use Case

Choose a region (like a part of Texas or Alberta), run the script, and get a shareable PDF with all the substations in that area.
